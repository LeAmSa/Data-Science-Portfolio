# Data Science Portfolio

The repository is composed of projects that I developed in the academic period and for self-learning purposes.  The discussions and developments of each project are in iPython Notebooks in their respective folders. 


*All data are publicly accessible or for research/demonstration purposes.*

## Content Summary
- ### Machine Learning
	- (***Deep Learning***) [Age Range Classification](https://github.com/LeAmSa/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/Age%20Range%20Classification%20with%20Deep%20Learning): This project represents my undergraduate final work for the Federal Technological University of Parana - Brazil in 2019. The objective was to realize age range estimation based on a convolutional neural network to differentiate minors from adults.
	- (***Deep Learning***) [Pneumonia Classification](https://github.com/LeAmSa/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/Pneumonia%20Classification): Using a convolutional neural network to analyze Chest X-ray images to classify if are Pneumonia cases or not.
	- (***Supervised Learning***) [Big Mart Sales Prediction](https://github.com/LeAmSa/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/Big%20Mart%20Sales%20Prediction): Analyzing the public Big Mart Sales dataset and creating regression models to predict the sales value based on multiple information on different products.
	- (***Supervised Learning***) [Hotel Booking Prediction](https://github.com/LeAmSa/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/Hotel%20Booking%20Prediction): Analyzing the public Hotel Booking dataset and creating classification models to predict the possibility of a booking.

- ### Micro Projects
	- (***Time Series***) [Air Passenger Time Series](https://github.com/LeAmSa/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Micro%20Projects/Air%20Passenger%20Time%20Series.ipynb): Analyzing and modeling a time series based on the public Air Passenger dataset.
	-  (***Text Mining***) [Text Mining with NLTK](https://github.com/LeAmSa/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Micro%20Projects/Text%20Mining%20with%20NLTK.ipynb): Applying text mining techniques in a small set of documents.
	
	*Main Tools:*
